<figcaption align = "center"><b>Fig.11 - Top: trends in sea salt aerosol mass emissions in the ensemble mean for the period 1951-2014. Bottom: historical and future (relative to the 1951-1971 mean) yearly time series (1951-2099) of average sea salt surface mass mixing ratio north of 60&deg;N (left) and south of 60&deg;S (right). Time series are smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter with a window length of 19 years and a polynomial order 3. Ensemble means are shown as thicker lines (black for the historical period, blue for SSP126, red for SSP585). Individual members use the same color code but with thinner lines. Included models are: GISS, HadGEM, MIROC-ES2L, MRI-ESM, NorESM and UKESM</b></figcaption>
